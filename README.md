# COMP 3010 In-Class Discussion Questions

if you want to catch up after skipping classes for any reason

**If you are a COMP 3010 student post-Fall 2025**: I'd strongly encourage you to *not* look at these notes before discussing any of these questions yourself in class time. Trying to figure it out even if you feel like you're unsure is part of the learning. This all started because I wanted to review these questions ahead of my test (which was tomorrow when I initially made this repository) and it greatly helped my learning process.

## Contributing

I'm only one person, and I might be wrong, and the course's entire thesis is more is better than one. I'd greatly appreciate any contribution to these notes for future learners' sakes.

Please fork the repository, make your edits in [notes.md](./notes.md), and submit a pull request. No conventions necessary; I'll manually review every single contribution.

If you're new to Git and GitHub, and want to learn, feel free to contact me via email or Discord and I'll give you a quick primer.
